# 🚀 KodNest Full-Stack Development Course Projects
=========================================================================================
This repository contains the projects I completed while learning full-stack development at KodNest. The primary focus of these projects is on frontend development, showcasing my skills in building user interfaces and interactive web applications. 💻

The projects are a practical application of the concepts and technologies covered in the course and demonstrate my proficiency in a range of technologies, including:

HTML: 🏗️ Structuring the content of web pages.

CSS: 🎨 Styling and visual presentation of the user interface.

JavaScript: ✨ Adding dynamic functionality and interactivity.

React: ⚛️ Building modular and reusable UI components.

Each project is located in its own folder, complete with a dedicated README.md file that provides a detailed overview of the project, including its purpose, the technologies used, and instructions on how to run it locally. 📖
